          To use x2.email you will need a CloudflareÂ® account and a web domain connected to it.

          <b>Why this complexity?</b>
          <br />
          This app is currently targeted at tech-savvy users with Cloudflare accounts, who own one or more domains.
          <br />
          <br />
          I built this app for myself because I need it.
          <br />
          <br />
          My goal is to build a sleek fancy UI to manage disposable emails and let Cloudflare do the heavy lifting.
